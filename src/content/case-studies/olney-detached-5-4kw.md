This illustrative case study demonstrates a larger 5.4kW array paired with a ~9.5kWh battery on a detached property in Olney. Optimisers manage partial shading from a nearby chimney stack.

Key figures:

- ~5,200 kWh/year generation
- ~£1,030/year bill savings + ~£150/year SEG export
- Indicative payback ~8.1 years

Notes: Battery sizing around 8–10kWh often balances cost and evening usage for family homes in MK.
