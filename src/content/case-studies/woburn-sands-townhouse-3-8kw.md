This illustrative case study shows a compact 3.8kW system on a Woburn Sands townhouse with an east/west split array. The output curve better matches morning and evening usage, improving self‑consumption versus a south‑only layout.

Headline outcomes:

- 10 panels (380W), Growatt 3.6kW inverter
- ~3,820 kWh/year generation (MK average conditions)
- Estimated £560/year bill savings + ~£90/year SEG export
- Indicative payback ~9.8 years (assumptions apply)

Notes: East/west strings provide smoother production through the day and are common in MK terraces and townhouses.
