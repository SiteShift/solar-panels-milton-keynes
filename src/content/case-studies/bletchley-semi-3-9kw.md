This case study is an illustrative example to demonstrate our reporting format. Real projects will include photographs, verifiable performance data, and customer permission.

Key outcomes:

- 10 panels (JA Solar 390W), Solis 3.6kW inverter, 5.2kWh battery
- ~3,950 kWh/year generation (MK average conditions)
- Estimated £740/year electricity savings + ~£95/year SEG export
- Indicative payback ~8.6 years (assumptions apply)

Notes: South‑east/east‑west arrays still perform strongly in MK. Battery helps capture evening usage and supports time‑of‑use tariffs.
