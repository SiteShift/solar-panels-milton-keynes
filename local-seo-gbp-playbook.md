### Local SEO & GBP Playbook (Connector Model)

This site operates as a connector brand (not the installer). Follow these steps to maximize local visibility while staying compliant with Google guidelines.

## 1) GBP Strategy
- Do not create a GBP for the connector brand unless operating as a legitimate Service‑Area Business (SAB) with verification assets (signage, tools, staff, vehicles). If SAB becomes feasible, hide address and set MK service areas.
- Partner Installer GBP Optimization (primary map pack presence):
  - Categories: Solar energy company (primary), Solar energy contractor, Electrical installation service
  - Services: Solar panel installation, Solar battery storage, Inverter replacement, Maintenance
  - Service areas: Milton Keynes + 25 miles
  - Photos: 10+ real photos (installs, teams, vehicles); add monthly
  - Posts: Weekly posts (case study, offer, guide link)
  - Products: “4kW Domestic Solar”, “6kW Solar with Battery” with price ranges
  - Q&A: Seed top questions with answers (planning permission, payback, grants)
  - Reviews: Post‑install SMS/email flow; reply to every review within 72h

## 2) Site NAP & Entity
- Keep connector brand NAP as city‑only + email (no street address).
- Use Organization + Service schema (areaServed: Milton Keynes). Avoid LocalBusiness unless SAB‑eligible.
- Partner profile pages (optional) may include partner NAP + LocalBusiness schema on those specific pages.

## 3) Citations (If Needed)
- Only create citations that support brand + service area without requiring a physical address.
- For partners: maintain consistent NAP across major directories (Yell, 192, FreeIndex) and industry sites (MCS directory). Link to this site’s relevant guides where appropriate.

## 4) Content & Links
- Publish local case studies and request a mention/link from partner sites (case study cross‑post).
- Secure inclusion on supplier/association “find an installer” pages.
- Sponsor local community initiatives and publish recap posts with photos.

## 5) Measurement
- Track calls/emails from partner GBP (use UTM links where applicable).
- Monitor Search Console by folders: `/milton-keynes/` (areas), hub pages, and content clusters.
